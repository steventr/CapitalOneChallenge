# CapitalOneChallenge (Winner)
Entry for CapitalOne's 2015 Software Engineer Conference application process
This uses Meteor, Instagram API, and AlchemyAPI to determine the top 20 most recent posts with the tag #CapitalOne, and
interprets a positive, negative, or neutral post. Using Bootstrap, the 20 photos, their users, the number of likes, and
a colored border are displayed. The color indicates the reaction. 

Was one of the 30~ or so selected for the conference on the east coast :D
